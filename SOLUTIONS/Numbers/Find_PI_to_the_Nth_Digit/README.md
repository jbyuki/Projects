# Find PI to the Nth digit

I'm using [Machin Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machin-like_formula) to approximate PI.
A lot of improvements can be made but the first 1000 decimals of PI could be computed using this program (personal objective).

Improvements include:
* Verify correctness to the Nth digit, no correctness is done currently
* Use a more sophisticated method to compute Pi
* Optimize the Ofloat.h utility
